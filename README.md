# Code for Enums in API-Platform

This repository contain a minimalist set of code
following this article https://les-tilleuls.coop/en/blog/how-to-expose-enums-with-api-platform

It is extracted from the distribution.

## Test it

```shell
composer install
Symfony serve
```

These 2 commands should be enough to get in the same state as I was in the end of the blog post.
